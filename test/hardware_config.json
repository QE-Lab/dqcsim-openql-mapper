Any two qubits which have near frequencies execute a two-qubit flux gate.  To prevent any neighbor qubit of the source qubit that has the same frequency as the target qubit to interact as well, those neighbors must have their frequency detuned (lowered out of the way).  A detuned qubit cannot execute a single-qubit rotation (an instruction of 'mw' type).  An edge is a pair of qubits which can execute a two-qubit flux gate.  There are 'count' qubits. For each edge it is described, when executing a two-qubit gate for it, which set of qubits it detunes.",
